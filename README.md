# NIRF-RANK-PREDICTOR
The goal of this machine learning problem is to build a predictive model that can accurately
estimate the NIRF ranking of colleges and universities based on a set of relevant features and
historical ranking data. By doing so, we aim to assist colleges and universities in assessing and
enhancing their performance in various NIRF ranking parameters.

It is carried out in following steps:-

• Data Preprocessing and data cleaning
• Transforming raw data into features that can be used to create predictive models
• Exploratory Data Analysis
• Assessing various Machine Learning models
• Training and Testing ML models
• Finalizing the best model suited.

As per the methodology of NIRF, there are five ranking parameters which are as follows:
• Teaching, learning, and resources
• Research and professional practice
• Graduation outcomes
• Outreach and inclusivity
• Peer perception
