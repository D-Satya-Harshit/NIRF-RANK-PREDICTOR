# NIRF-RANK-PREDICTOR
#Overview
This project aims to build a predictive machine learning model to estimate the NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) rankings of colleges and universities. By leveraging a set of relevant features and historical ranking data, the model helps institutions assess and enhance their performance across various NIRF ranking parameters.

#Project Objectives
The main goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate NIRF rankings based on historical data and relevant features. This model will assist colleges and universities in evaluating their performance and identifying areas for improvement in alignment with NIRF criteria.

#Methodology
The project is executed through the following key steps:

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset. Normalizing and standardizing data to prepare it for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Transforming raw data into meaningful features suitable for predictive modeling. Selecting and creating features that influence NIRF rankings.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing data distributions and relationships to gain insights. Visualizing patterns and trends relevant to the ranking parameters.
Model Assessment: Evaluating various machine learning models to determine their effectiveness. Comparing model performance using appropriate metrics.
Training and Testing: Training selected machine learning models on historical ranking data. Testing model accuracy and generalizability on unseen data.
Model Selection: Finalizing the best-performing model based on evaluation results. Refining and tuning the chosen model for optimal performance.
NIRF Ranking Parameters
The NIRF methodology includes five key ranking parameters:

Teaching, Learning, and Resources: Evaluates the quality of teaching, learning infrastructure, and resources available.
Research and Professional Practice: Assesses research output, quality, and professional practices.
Graduation Outcomes: Measures the outcomes related to graduation, such as employability and further studies.
Outreach and Inclusivity: Examines efforts to reach diverse populations and promote inclusivity.
Peer Perception: Considers the perception of the institution among peers and academic community.
